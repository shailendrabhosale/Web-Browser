Developed a multi-window web browser using JavaFX, featuring a graphical user interface with custom buttons and tab switching.
 Utilized data structures such as stacks and lists for efficient tab management and switching. Implemented functionality for creating and
 managing multiple c2w_BrowserWindow instances, maintaining an active list of open windows, and ensuring program termination upon
 closure of all windows.
